### Project Overview
In this project I wrangle and analyse the data base of a digital music store "Chinook". I query data usin SQL to answer the question of 4 interesting questions and represent their answers through for the output.

<br />The visual representation PDF slide includes: <br />- Four slides
<br />- One visualization per slide
<br />- A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
<br />- The SQL query is used to create the data used in the visualization.

### ***Steps to run this project***
1. __Download the Chinook database from here__ ==> [chinook-db.zip](https://github.com/ManuelHany/Digital_MusicStore_DB_analysis/files/8840062/chinook-db.zip)
2. __Download DB browser for SQLite, or any open source tool compatible with SQL.__
3. __Navigate to the Chinook.db file (probably in your downloads)__
4. __Click on the Execute SQL__
5. __Copy and paste each of the 4 queries written in the SQL script, run them and observe their output.__
6. __Using output from step number 5, find out the data I used to prepare the visuals found in the answer to the questions inside the PDF slides file.__
7. __Let me know if you have any other interesting questions to ask.__
